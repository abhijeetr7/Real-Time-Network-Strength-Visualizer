# Real-Time-Network-Strength-Visualizer

Real-Time Network Strength Visualizer
This is a simple, client-side web application designed to simulate and visualize network strength and latency in real-time. It provides a quick glance at your simulated connection quality through animated signal bars and a latency display.

üí° Concept
The tool aims to provide a visual representation of network performance, ideal for a quick check or as a sidebar utility. While it simulates network checks in this environment, the concept is to mimic real-world monitoring.

üîß Key Features
Simulated Auto-updates: The visualizer automatically updates its display every 5 seconds, providing a continuous "real-time" feel.

Simulated Ping + Latency Check: It simulates a network ping to generate a random latency value (between 30ms and 500ms), which is then used to determine signal strength.

Wi-Fi or Mobile-style Signal Animation: Animated signal bars visually represent the network strength, changing color and number of active bars based on the simulated latency.

Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS, the interface is designed to be responsive and look good on various screen sizes.

‚öôÔ∏è How it Works
The application is built using standard web technologies:

HTML: Provides the structure of the visualizer.

CSS (Tailwind CSS & Custom): Styles the elements, creates the signal bars, and implements the animations.

JavaScript:

The checkLatency() function simulates network latency using setTimeout to resolve a random millisecond value. This avoids "Failed to fetch" errors that can occur in sandboxed environments when trying to make external network requests.

The updateUI() function takes the simulated latency and translates it into a visual representation by:

Updating the displayed latency value.

Determining the number of active signal bars (1 to 4) and their corresponding color (red, orange, green) based on latency thresholds.

Applying a subtle pulsing animation to the active bars.

The runNetworkCheck() function orchestrates the process, calling checkLatency() and then updateUI().

An setInterval call ensures runNetworkCheck() is executed repeatedly at a defined interval (every 5 seconds).

üöÄ Usage
Simply open the index.html file in a web browser. The visualizer will start automatically, simulating network strength and updating every few seconds.
